# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualisation and Exploration
# Problem Statement:
  The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
# Approach:
  1. Data extraction: Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository using scripting to retrieve the data, which may then be stored in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.
  2. Data transformation: To alter and pre-process the data, use tools like Pandas and scripting languages like Python. This could entail preparing the data for analysis and display, managing missing numbers, and cleansing the data.
  3. Database insertion: Connect to a MySQL database with Python using the "mysql-connector-python" module, then use SQL statements to insert the modified data.
  4. Dashboard creation: Create a dynamic and eye-catching dashboard using Python's Streamlit and Plotly modules. The data may be displayed on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map features, and Streamlit can be used to provide an intuitive user interface with a variety of dropdown menus for users to choose the facts and statistics to display.
  5. Data retrieval: Connect to the MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" module, and then download the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the information in the dataframe to dynamically refresh the dashboard.
  6. Deployment: Make sure the solution is reliable, effective, and easy to use. Thoroughly evaluate the solution and launch the dashboard publicly so that users can view it.
